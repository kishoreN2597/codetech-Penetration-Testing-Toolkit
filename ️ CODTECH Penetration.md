# 🛡️ CODTECH Penetration Testing Toolkit (GUI)

A Python-based **ethical hacking toolkit** built for the CODTECH Cyber Security Internship (Task – 3).  
This toolkit provides a graphical interface to perform **safe, non-destructive** penetration testing actions such as:

- 🔍 Port Scanning  
- 📝 Banner Grabbing  
- 📡 Ping Tester  
- 🔐 Local Password Auditor  
- 🧰 Modular, extendable structure  

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> This toolkit is for **educational and authorized security testing only**.  
> Do **NOT** run scans on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
